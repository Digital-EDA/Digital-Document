## <code>Digital IDE</code> | All in one <code>vscode</code> plugin for Verilog/VHDL development

[Document (New)](https://sterben.nitcloud.cn/) | [ä¸­æ–‡æ–‡æ¡£ (New)](https://sterben.nitcloud.cn/zh/) | [Bilibili Video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1t14y1179V/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0)

Digital IDE (dide for short) is a user-friendly and efficient development tool designed for digital developers. We are committed to the development concept where the file structure corresponds directly to the project structure. With a standardized, simplified, and visualized project management system, IP management system, and a variety of auxiliary components, we help downstream developers meet the requirements of agile development, verification, and team collaboration during the R&D process. For upstream, we assist FPGA vendors in reducing the cost of expanding and maintaining their software development ecosystems.

2. One-Click Synthesis: Select the module to be synthesized, click the synthesis button to generate a netlist, and render it in the netlist view.
3. Top-Level Module Definition: Right-click the module to be set as the top-level, and choose to set it as the design or simulation top-level.
4. Export Module Dependencies: Right-click the module to export, and choose to export it as a `filelist.f` file.
5. Improved Rendering Stability: Fixed known bugs and enhanced the structure tree rendering for backend debugging.
6. Support for Xilinx File Structures: Added functionality to convert standard Xilinx file structures into the pluginâ€™s standard file structure.
7. User Library Path Issue Resolved: Fixed the issue preventing user library paths from being imported.
8. Enhanced Instance Generation: Added support for command-line selection and autocomplete.
