## Install beta version

If you want to use the latest beta version of our plugin, you can obtain it through the following methods:

1. Join our QQ discussion group (932987873) and download `fpga-support-{version}.vsix`.
2. Download `fpga-support-{version}.vsix` from [releases](https://github.com/Digital-EDA/Digital-IDE/releases).

We recommend joining our group chat, as it offers the following benefits:

1. Experience new versions earlier. Beta versions are released for internal testing 3–4 months before the official release.
2. Quickly resolve any issues you encounter.
3. Receive prompt responses to your feature requests.

Once you download the vsix, you can install from vsix:
