## Language Services Introduction

The "Language Service" in code design is a core tool that enhances the coding and development experience by providing features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, definition navigation, and refactoring suggestions.

1. Benefits of Language Service: Boosting Development Efficiency Language services enable developers to focus on logic design and critical business code by reducing manual input and repetitive operations through features like auto-completion and quick fixes. This accelerates the development process.
2. Improving Code Quality: Through static analysis, code checking, and warnings, language services help identify potential syntax errors, type mismatches, and other issues. This reduces common mistakes and ensures higher code quality during the writing phase.
3. Enhancing Development Experience: Features like syntax highlighting, real-time error prompts, and code formatting improve code readability and structure. Additionally, inline documentation and parameter hints make it easier for developers to understand API usage, enhancing the user experience.
4. Supporting Code Refactoring: Refactoring operations like renaming, method extraction, and file relocation provided by language services make code optimization and improvements faster and more precise, helping developers maintain clean and manageable code.
5. Aiding New Technology Learning: Detailed code documentation and intelligent suggestions help developers quickly familiarize themselves with new programming languages, libraries, or frameworks. This is especially valuable when exploring a new technology stack or working with unfamiliar code.
6. Enhancing Team Collaboration: Language services ensure code consistency in a collaborative environment, reducing stylistic differences among developers. This facilitates subsequent code reviews, integration, and maintenance.

**Features Supported**:
- Syntax highlighting
- Syntax diagnostics
- File outline
- Hover tooltips
- Auto-completion
- Definition navigation
- Code formatting
- Code translation

Compared to version 0.3.x, version 0.4.x and later versions support single-file language services. This eliminates the need to open the entire folder when using HDL language services.

Details on how to use these features and their effects are provided below:
