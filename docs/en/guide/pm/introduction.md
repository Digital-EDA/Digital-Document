## The Significance of Project Management

"Project Management" is a feature used to organize and manage code files, resources, and configurations. Its primary goal is to help developers efficiently organize, navigate, and operate various elements within a project.

Typical Features of Project Management:
- Managing project structure
- Dependency management
- Build and run configurations
- Version control

Significance and Purpose
1. Improving Project Organization: Project management provides a unified view of the project structure, neatly organizing source code, configuration files, and resource files in a file tree. This clear hierarchy makes files easy to find and manage, preventing disorganization.
2. Simplifying Dependency Management: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) typically support automatic management of project dependencies, such as third-party libraries, frameworks, or modules. This centralized management minimizes compatibility issues and improves project stability and maintainability.
3. Accelerating Build and Deployment: Project management allows developers to configure and execute build scripts (e.g., Gradle, Maven) or runtime environments. Automating the build, testing, packaging, and deployment processes significantly speeds up development and reduces manual intervention.
4. Supporting Multi-Environment Configurations: Developers can define different configurations (e.g., development, testing, production environments) through project management, enabling seamless switching between configurations. This flexibility enhances testing and deployment efficiency.
5. Enhancing Code Navigation and Refactoring: With project management, developers can quickly locate files, classes, or function definitions, improving navigation efficiency. IDEs also provide batch refactoring support, maintaining project flexibility and consistency.
6. Facilitating Team Collaboration: Integration with version control systems (e.g., Git) makes it easier for teams to manage branches, resolve merge conflicts, and conduct code reviews, improving collaboration and code quality.
7. Improving Project Portability: Standardized project structure and configuration files ensure easy handover or migration, reducing the complexity of dependencies and environment setups.

## Business Categories
Project management can be categorized into the following business areas:

1. Project Setup
   1. Project Management (PS & PL)
   2. Library Management (IP & BD)
2. Simulation Setup
   1. Generate Instance & Testbench File
   2. Fast Simulation
3. Design Assistance
   1. [x]Tree Structure
   2. [x]Netlist preview
   3. [x]Code to doc
   4. [x]Fsm preview
   5. [x]Waveform preview
   6. []Fsm designer
   7. 
For project setup and simulation setup, the plugin automatically constructs dependencies, truly enabling one-click convenience for management.
